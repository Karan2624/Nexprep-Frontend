## 🌟 About the Project

**NexPrep** is built for modern developers preparing for technical interviews. Aiming for top tech companies requires consistency, targeted practice, and peer support. 

Instead of juggling multiple tools for tracking tasks, finding previous year questions, and discussing with peers, NexPrep brings it all together. It provides curated resources, progress analytics, daily task scheduling, and a real-time collaborative chat environment—all tightly integrated into one sleek, highly-responsive platform.
